I HAVE RETURNED from the snowy winterlands of Connecticut, bringing with me two as-yet-unpacked suitcases of freshly laundered clothing and miscellaneous goods -- I have also brought a strange illness that caused me to basically blow my nose for five hours straight on the airplane, much to the delight of the passengers sharing my immediate space.
